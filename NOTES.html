    What is HTML? 
<ul>
<li> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup 
Language </li>
<li> HTML is the standard markup language for 
creating Web pages </li>
<li>  HTML describes the structure of a Web 
page </li>
<li>  HTML consists of a series of elements </li>
<li>  HTML elements tell the browser how to 
display the content </li>
<li>  HTML elements label pieces of content such 
as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", 
"this is a link", etc. </li>

What is an HTML Element? 
<ul>
 An HTML element is defined by a start tag, 
some content, and an end tag: &lt;li&gt;
<li> &lt;tagname&gt;Content goes here... &lt;tagname&gt; &lt;li&gt;
<li> The HTML element is everything from the 
start tag to the end tag: &lt;li&gt;
<li> &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;h1&gt;
 <li> &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;p&gt;
</ul>
Start tag Element content End tag <br>
&lt;h1&gt; My First Heading &lt;h1&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph. &lt;p&gt;<br>
&lt;br&gt;none none<br>
Web Browsers <br>
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, <br>
Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and <br>
display them correctly. <br>
A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses <br>
them to determine how to display the document: <br>
HTML Page Structure <br>
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure: <br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt; <br>
&lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;title&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt; <br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;h1&gt; <br>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;p&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;p&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt; <br>
Note: The content inside the &lt;body&gt; section <br>
(the white area above) will be displayed in a <br>
browser. The content inside the &lt;title&gt; element <br>
will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the <br>
page's tab. <br>
HTML History <br>



Since the early days of the World Wide Web, there <br>
have been many versions of HTML: <br>

Step 1: Open Notepad (PC) 
Windows 8 or later:
Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the 
bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad
Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says 
"Display HTML files as HTML code instead of 
formatted text". 
Then open a new document to place the code.

It is the perfect tool when you want to test code fast. 
It also has color coding and the ability to save and 
share code with others: 
Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
HTML Documents 
All HTML documents must start with a document 
type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>. 
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and 
ends with </html>. 
The visible part of the HTML document is 
between <body> and </body>. 
Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration 
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the 
document type, and helps browsers to display web 
pages correctly. 
It must only appear once, at the top of the page 
(before any HTML tags). 
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive. 
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
HTML Headings 
HTML headings are defined with 
the <h1> to <h6> tags. 
<h1> defines the most important 
heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
HTML Paragraphs 
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: 
Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
HTML Links 
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag: 
Example:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a 
link</a>
4 
The link's destination is specified in 
the href attribute. 
Attributes are used to provide additional information 
about HTML elements. 
You will learn more about attributes in a later 
chapter. 
HTML Images 
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag. 
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, 
and height are provided as attributes: 
Example:
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" wid
th="104" height="142">
How to View HTML Source 
View HTML Source Code: 
Right-click in an HTML page and select "View Page 
Source" (in Chrome) or "View Source" (in Edge), or 
similar in other browsers. This will open a window 
containing the HTML source code of the page. 
Inspect an HTML Element: 
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and 
choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to see what 
elements are made up of (you will see both the 
HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or 
CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that 
opens. 
HTML Elements 
The HTML element is everything from the start tag 
to the end tag: 
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements: 
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag Element content End tag 
<h1> My First Heading </h1> 
<p> My first paragraph. </p> 
<br> none none
Note: Empty elements have no end tags 
Nested HTML Elements 
HTML elements can be nested (this means that 
elements can contain other elements). 
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML 
elements. 
The following example contains four HTML 
elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>): 
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
The <html> element is the root element and it defines 
the whole HTML document. 
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>. 
Then, inside the <html> element there is 
a <body> element: 
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
5 
</body>
The <body> element defines the document's body. 
It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>. 
Then, inside the <body> element there are two other 
elements: <h1> and <p>: 
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
The <h1> element defines a heading. 
It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>: 
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
The <p> element defines a paragraph. 
It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>: 
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Never Skip the End Tag 
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if 
you forget the end tag: 
Example:
<html>
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph 
<p>This is a paragraph 
</body>
</html>
However, never rely on this! Unexpected results 
and errors may occur if you forget the end tag!
Empty HTML Elements 
HTML elements with no content are called empty 
elements. 
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty 
element without a closing tag: 
Example:
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
HTML is Case Sensitive 
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the 
same as <p>. 
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, 
but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, 
and demands lowercase for stricter document types 
like XHTML.
HTML Tag Reference 
Tag Description 
<html> Defines the root of an HTML document 
<body> Defines the document's body 
<h1> to 
<h6>
Defines HTML headings 
HTML Attributes 
 All HTML elements can have attributes
 Attributes provide additional 
information about elements 
 Attributes are always specified in the start 
tag
 Attributes usually come in name/value pairs 
like: name="value"
The href Attribute 
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute 
specifies the URL of the page the link goes to: 
Example:
<a href="https://try.com">visit our school</a>
6 
The src Attribute 
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an 
HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to 
the image to be displayed: 
Example:
<img src="img_girl.jpg">
There are two ways to specify the URL in 
the src attribute: 
1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is 
hosted on another website. 
Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/i
mg_girl.jpg". 
Notes: External images might be under copyright. If 
you do not get permission to use it, you may be in 
violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot 
control external images; it can suddenly be removed 
or changed. 
2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted 
within the website. Here, the URL does not include 
the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, 
it will be relative to the current page. Example: 
src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it 
will be relative to the domain. Example: 
src="/images/img_girl.jpg". 
Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. 
They will not break if you change domain. 
The width and height Attributes 
The <img> tag should also contain 
the width and height attributes, which specify the 
width and height of the image (in pixels): 
Example:
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
The alt Attribute 
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies 
an alternate text for an image, if the image for some 
reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow 
connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the 
user uses a screen reader. 
Example:
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
<img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
The style Attribute 
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, 
such as color, font, size, and more. 
Example:
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
The lang Attribute 
You should always include the lang attribute inside 
the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web 
page. This is meant to assist search engines and 
browsers. 
The following example specifies English as the 
language: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
... 
</body>
</html>
Country codes can also be added to the language 
code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters 
define the language of the HTML page, and the last 
two characters define the country. 
The following example specifies English as the 
language and United States as the country: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
... 
</body>
</html>
The title Attribute 
7 
The title attribute defines some extra information 
about an element. 
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a 
tooltip when you mouse over the element: 
Example:
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
The HTML standard does not require lowercase 
attribute names. 
The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be 
written with uppercase or lowercase 
like title or TITLE. 
The HTML standard does not require quotes around 
attribute values. 
Good:
<a href="https://www.try.com/html/">Visit our 
HTML tutorial</a> 
Bad:
<a href=https://www.try.com/html/>Visit our HTML 
tutorial</a>
Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will 
not display the title attribute correctly, because it 
contains a space: 
Example:
<p title=About My school>
Single or Double Quotes? 
Double quotes around attribute values are the most 
common in HTML, but single quotes can also be 
used. 
In some situations, when the attribute value itself 
contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single 
quotes: 
<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa: 
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson"> 
HTML Headings 
HTML headings are defined with 
the <h1> to <h6> tags. 
<h1> defines the most important 
heading. <h6> defines the least important heading. 
Example:
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
Headings Are Important 
Search engines use the headings to index the structure 
and content of your web pages. 
Users often skim a page by its headings. It is 
important to use headings to show the document 
structure. 
<h1> headings should be used for main headings, 
followed by <h2> headings, then the less 
important <h3>, and so on. 
HTML Paragraphs 
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph. 
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and 
browsers automatically add some white space (a 
margin) before and after a paragraph. 
Example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
HTML Display 
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. 
Large or small screens, and resized windows will 
create different results. 
8 
With HTML, you cannot change the display by 
adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML 
code. 
The browser will automatically remove any extra 
spaces and lines when the page is displayed: 
Example:
<p>
This paragraph 
contains a lot of lines 
in the source code, 
but the browser 
ignores it. 
</p>
<p>
This paragraph 
contains a lot of spaces 
in the source code, 
but the browser 
ignores it. 
</p>
HTML Horizontal Rules 
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML 
page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. 
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or 
define a change) in an HTML page: 
Example:
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
HTML Line Breaks 
The HTML <br> element defines a line break. 
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) 
without starting a new paragraph: 
Example:
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
The Poem Problem 
This poem will display on a single line: 
Example:
<p>
 My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
 My Bonnie lies over the sea. 
 My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
 Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me. 
</p>
Solution - The HTML <pre> Element 
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. 
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a 
fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves 
both spaces and line breaks: 
Example:
<pre>
 My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
 My Bonnie lies over the sea. 
 My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
 Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me. 
</pre>
Tag Description 
<p> Defines a paragraph 
<hr> Defines a thematic change in the content 
<br> Inserts a single line break 
<pre> Defines pre-formatted text 
9 
The HTML Style Attribute 
Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done 
with the style attribute. 
The HTML style attribute has the following syntax: 

Background Color 
The CSS background-color property defines the 
background color for an HTML element. 
Example: 
<body style="background-color:powderblue;">
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
Example: 
Set background color for two different elements: 
<body>
<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">This is a 
heading</h1>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a 
paragraph.</p>
</body>
Text Color 
The CSS color property defines the text color for an 
HTML element: 
Example:
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
Fonts 
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be 
used for an HTML element: 
Example:
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a 
heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a 
paragraph.</p>
Text Size 
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for 
an HTML element: 
Example:
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>
Text Alignment 
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal 
text alignment for an HTML element: 
Example:
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered 
Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered 
paragraph.</p>
HTML Formatting Elements 
Formatting elements were designed to display special 
types of text: 
 <b> - Bold text 
 <strong> - Important text 
 <i> - Italic text 
 <em> - Emphasized text 
 <mark> - Marked text 
 <small> - Smaller text 
 <del> - Deleted text 
 <ins> - Inserted text 
 <sub> - Subscript text 
 <sup> - Superscript text 
HTML <b> and <strong> Elements 
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without 
any extra importance. 
Example:
10 
<b>This text is bold</b>
The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong 
importance. The content inside is typically displayed 
in bold. 
Example:
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
HTML <i> and <em> Elements 
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an 
alternate voice or mood. The content inside is 
typically displayed in italic. 
Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical 
term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a 
ship name, etc. 
Example:
<i>This text is italic</i>
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. 
The content inside is typically displayed in italic. 
Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words 
in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress. 
Example:
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
HTML <small> Element 
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text: 
Example:
<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
HTML <mark> Element 
The HTML <mark> element defines text that should 
be marked or highlighted: 
Example:
<p>Do not forget to 
buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
HTML <del> Element 
The HTML <del> element defines text that has been 
deleted from a document. Browsers will usually 
strike a line through deleted text: 
Example:
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
HTML <ins> Element 
The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has 
been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually 
underline inserted text: 
Example:
<p>My favorite color 
is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
HTML <sub> Element 
The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. 
Subscript text appears half a character below the 
normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller 
font. Subscript text can be used for chemical 
formulas, like H2O: 
Example:
<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
HTML <sup> Element 
The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. 
Superscript text appears half a character above the 
normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller 
font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like 
WWW[1]: 
Example:
<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
