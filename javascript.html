        <h1> JavaScript Notes </h1>
<plaintext>
    JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. JavaScript is the programming 
    language of the Web. JavaScript is easy to learn. This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from 
    basic to advanced. 
    JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design. JavaScript 
    was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. 
    JavaScript Can Change HTML Content 
    One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById(). 
    The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element 
    content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript": 
    Example 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript"; 
    JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes 
    JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS) 
    Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute: 
    Example 
    document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px"; 
    JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements 
    Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style: 
    Example 
    document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none"; 
    JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements 
    Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style: 
    Example 
    2 
    document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block"; 
    The <script> Tag 
    In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags. 
    Example 
    <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript"; 
    </script>
    JavaScript Functions and Events 
    A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for. 
    For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button. 
    JavaScript in <head> or <body> 
    You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document. 
    Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both. 
    JavaScript in <head> 
    In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page. 
    The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked: 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <script>
    function myFunction() { 
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed."; 
    } 
    </script>
    3 
    </head>
    <body>
    <h2>Demo JavaScript in Head</h2>
    <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    JavaScript in <body> 
    In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <body> section of an HTML page. 
    The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked: 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <h2>Demo JavaScript in Body</h2>
    <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
    <script>
    function myFunction() { 
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed."; 
    } 
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    External JavaScript 
    Scripts can also be placed in external files: 
    4 
    External file: myScript.js 
    function myFunction() { 
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed."; 
    } 
    External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages. 
    JavaScript files have the file extension .js. 
    To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of 
    a <script> tag: 
    Example 
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>
    You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like. 
    The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located. 
    External scripts cannot contain <script> tags. 
    External JavaScript Advantages 
    Placing scripts in external files has some advantages: 
     It separates HTML and code 
     It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain 
     Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads 
    To add several script files to one page - use several script tags: 
    Example 
    <script src="myScript1.js"></script>
    <script src="myScript2.js"></script>
    External References 
    An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways: 
     With a full URL (a full web address) 
     With a file path (like /js/) 
    5 
     Without any path 
    This example uses a full URL to link to myScript.js: 
    Example 
    <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>
    This example uses a file path to link to myScript.js: 
    Example 
    <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
    This example uses no path to link to myScript.js: 
    Example 
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>
    JavaScript Display Possibilities 
    JavaScript can "display" data in different ways: 
     Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML. 
     Writing into the HTML output using document.write(). 
     Writing into an alert box, using window.alert(). 
     Writing into the browser console, using console.log(). 
    Using inner HTML 
    To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method. 
    The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML 
    content: 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    6 
    <p>My First Paragraph</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6; 
    </script>
    </body>
    </html> 
    Using document.write() 
    For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write(): 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <script>
    document.write(5 + 6); 
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Try it</button>
    7 
    </body>
    </html>
    Using window.alert() 
    You can use an alert box to display data: 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <script>
    window.alert(5 + 6); 
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    You can skip the window keyword. In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. 
    This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This 
    also means that specifying the window keyword is optional. 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <script>
    alert(5 + 6); 
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    8 
    Using console.log() 
    For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data. 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <script>
    console.log(5 + 6); 
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    JavaScript Print: JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods. You cannot access 
    output devices from JavaScript. The only exception is that you can call 
    the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window. 
    Example 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    JavaScript Statements 
    Example 
    let x, y, z; // Statement 1 
    x = 5; // Statement 2 
    y = 6; // Statement 3 
    z = x + y; // Statement 4
    JavaScript Programs 
    A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. 
    In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. 
    9 
    A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements. 
    In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser. 
    JavaScript Statements 
    JavaScript statements are composed of: 
    Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. 
    This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with 
    id="demo": 
    Example 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly."; 
    Semicolons ; 
    Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. 
    Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement: 
    Examples 
    let a, b, c; // Declare 3 variables 
    a = 5; // Assign the value 5 to a 
    b = 6; // Assign the value 6 to b 
    c = a + b; // Assign the sum of a and b to c
    JavaScript White Space 
    JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more 
    readable. 
    The following lines are equivalent: 
    let person = "Hege"; 
    let person="Hege"; 
    JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks 
    For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. 
    10 
    If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: 
    Example 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
    "Hello Dolly!"; 
    JavaScript Code Blocks 
    JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}. 
    The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together. 
    One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions: 
    Example 
    function myFunction() { 
     document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!"; 
     document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?"; 
    } 
    JavaScript Keywords 
    Keyword Description 
    var Declares a variable 
    let Declares a block variable 
    const Declares a block constant 
    if Marks a block of statements 
    to be executed on a 
    condition 
    switch Marks a block of statements 
    to be executed in different 
    cases 
    11 
    for Marks a block of statements 
    to be executed in a loop 
    function Declares a function 
    return Exits a function 
    try Implements error handling 
    to a block of statements 
    JavaScript Syntax 
    JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed: 
    // How to create variables: 
    var x; 
    let y; 
    // How to use variables: 
    x = 5; 
    y = 6; 
    let z = x + y; 
    JavaScript Values 
    The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: 
     Fixed values 
     Variable values 
    Fixed values are called Literals. Variable values are called Variables. 
    JavaScript Literals 
    The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are: 
    1. Numbers are written with or without decimals: 
    12 
    10.50
    1001
    2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes: 
    "John Doe"
    'John Doe'
    JavaScript Variables 
    In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. JavaScript uses the 
    keywords var, let and const to declare variables. 
    An equal sign is used to assign values to variables. In this example, x is defined as a variable. 
    Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6: 
    let x; 
    x = 6; 
    JavaScript Operators 
    JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values: 
    (5 + 6) * 10
    JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables: 
    let x, y; 
    x = 5; 
    y = 6; 
    JavaScript Expressions 
    An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value. 
    The computation is called an evaluation. 
    For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50: 
    5 * 10
    The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings. 
    13 
    For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe": 
    "John" + " " + "Doe"
    JavaScript Keywords 
    JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed. 
    The let keyword tells the browser to create variables: 
    let x, y; 
    x = 5 + 6; 
    y = x * 10; 
    The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables: 
    var x, y; 
    x = 5 + 6; 
    y = x * 10; 
    JavaScript Comments 
    Not all JavaScript statements are "executed". 
    Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment. 
    Comments are ignored, and will not be executed: 
    let x = 5; // I will be executed 
    // x = 6; I will NOT be executed
    JavaScript Identifiers / Names 
    Identifiers are JavaScript names. Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and 
    functions. The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages. 
    A JavaScript name must begin with: 
     A letter (A-Z or a-z) 
     A dollar sign ($) 
     Or an underscore (_) 
    14 
    Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. 
    JavaScript is Case Sensitive 
    All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
    The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables: 
    let lastname, lastName; 
    lastName = "Doe"; 
    lastname = "Peterson"; 
    Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions. 
    JavaScript Character Set 
    JavaScript uses the Unicode character set. Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, 
    punctuations, and symbols in the world. 
    JavaScript Comments 
    Single Line Comments 
    Single line comments start with //. 
    Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed). 
    This example uses a single-line comment before each code line: 
    Example 
    // Change heading: 
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page"; 
    // Change paragraph: 
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph."; 
    This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code: 
    Example 
    let x = 5; // Declare x, give it the value of 5 
    let y = x + 2; // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2 
    15 
    Multi-line Comments 
    Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. 
    Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript. 
    This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code: 
    Example 
    /* 
    The code below will change 
    the heading with id = "myH" 
    and the paragraph with id = "myP" 
    in my web page: 
    */
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page"; 
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph."; 
    JavaScript Variables 
    4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable: 
     Using var
     Using let
     Using const
     Using nothing 
     What are Variables? 
     Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values). 
     In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword: 
    Example 
    var x = 5; 
    var y = 6; 
    var z = x + y; 
    In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword: 
    Example 
    16 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 6; 
    let z = x + y; 
    In this example, x, y, and z, are undeclared variables: 
    Example 
    x = 5; 
    y = 6; 
    z = x + y; 
    When to Use JavaScript var? 
    Always declare JavaScript variables with var, let, or const. The var keyword is used in all 
    JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 
    2015. If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var. 
    When to Use JavaScript const? 
    If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const. If you think the value of the 
    variable can change, use let. In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables: 
    Example 
    const price1 = 5; 
    const price2 = 6; 
    let total = price1 + price2; 
    The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword. These are constant 
    values and cannot be changed. The variable total is declared with the let keyword. This is a value 
    that can be changed. 
    JavaScript Identifiers 
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are 
    called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, 
    sum, totalVolume). 
    The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: 
     Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. 
     Names must begin with a letter. 
    17 
     Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial). 
     Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables). 
     Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names. 
    JavaScript Dollar Sign $ 
    Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names: 
    Example 
    let $ = "Hello World"; 
    let $$$ = 2; 
    let $myMoney = 5; 
    JavaScript Let 
    The let keyword was introduced in 2015. 
    Variables defined with let cannot be Re-declared. Variables defined with let must be Declared 
    before use. Variables defined with let have Block Scope. Variables defined with let cannot 
    be redeclared. 
    With let you can not do this: 
    Example 
    let x = "John Doe"; 
    let x = 0; 
    // SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared
    With var you can: 
    Example 
    var x = "John Doe"; 
    var x = 0; 
    JavaScript Const 
    Variables defined with const cannot be Re-declared. Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned. A const variable cannot be reassigned: 
    18 
    Example 
    const PI = 3.141592653589793; 
    PI = 3.14; // This will give an error 
    PI = PI + 10; // This will also give an error
    When to use JavaScript const? 
    Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.
    Use const when you declare: 
     A new Array 
     A new Object 
     A new Function 
     A new RegExp 
    Constant Arrays 
    You can change the elements of a constant array: 
    Example 
    // You can create a constant array: 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
    // You can change an element: 
    cars[0] = "Toyota"; 
    // You can add an element: 
    cars.push("Audi"); 
    Constant Objects 
    You can change the properties of a constant object: 
    Example 
    // You can create a const object: 
    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}; 
    // You can change a property: 
    car.color = "red"; 
    19 
    // You can add a property: 
    car.owner = "Johnson"; 
    JavaScript Operators 
    Assignment Examples 
    let x = 10; 
    // Assign the value 5 to x 
    let x = 5; 
    // Assign the value 2 to y 
    let y = 2; 
    // Assign the value x + y to z: 
    let z = x + y; 
    Adding 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 2; 
    let z = x + y; 
    The Multiplication Operator (*) multiplies numbers. 
    Multiplying 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 2; 
    let z = x * y; 
    Types of JavaScript Operators 
    There are different types of JavaScript operators: 
     Arithmetic Operators 
     Assignment Operators 
     Comparison Operators 
     Logical Operators 
     Conditional Operators 
     Type Operators 
    JavaScript Arithmetic Operators 
    Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers: 
    20 
    Arthmetic Operators Example 
    let a = 3; 
    let x = (100 + 50) * a; 
    Example: 
    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html> 
    <body> 
    <h1>JavaScript Arithmetic</h1> 
    <h2>Arithmetic Operations</h2> 
    <p>A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers (or expressions) and produces a new 
    number.</p> 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    <script> 
    let a = 3; 
    let x = (100 + 50) * a; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
    </script></body></html> 
    Output: 450 
    Operator Example Same As 
    = x = y x = y 
    += x += y x = x + y 
    21 
    -= x -= y x = x - y 
    *= x *= y x = x * y 
    /= x /= y x = x / y 
    %= x %= y x = x % y 
    **= x **= y x = x ** y 
    Adding JavaScript Strings 
    The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings. 
    Example 
    let text1 = "John"; 
    let text2 = "Doe"; 
    let text3 = text1 + " " + text2; 
    The result of text3 will be: 
    John Doe 
    JavaScript Comparison Operators 
    Operator Description 
    == equal to 
    === equal value and equal type 
    Strict equality using === 
    If the values have the same type, are not numbers, and have 
    the same value, they're considered equal. Finally, if both 
    values are numbers, they're considered equal if they're both not 
    NaN and are the same value, or if one is +0 and one is -0 .
    22 
    != not equal 
    !== not equal value or not equal type 
    > greater than 
    < less than 
    >= greater than or equal to 
    <= less than or equal to 
    ? ternary operator 
    JavaScript Logical Operators 
    Operator Description 
    && logical and 
    || logical or 
    ! logical not 
    JavaScript Type Operators 
    Operator Description 
    typeof Returns the 
    type of a 
    variable 
    instanceof Returns true 
    if an object is 
    23 
    an instance 
    of an object 
    type 
    JavaScript Bitwise Operators 
    Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers. 
    Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted 
    back to a JavaScript number. 
    Operator Description Example Same as Result Decimal
    & AND 5 & 1 0101 &

    JavaScript Arithmetic Operators 
    Example 
    let x = 100 + 50; 
    Example 
    let x = (100 + 50) * a; 
    Adding 
    24 
    The addition operator (+) adds numbers: 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 2; 
    let z = x + y; 
    Subtracting 
    The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers. 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 2; 
    let z = x - y; 
    Multiplying 
    The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 2; 
    let z = x * y; 
    Dividing 
    The division operator (/) divides numbers. 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 2; 
    let z = x / y; 
    Remainder 
    The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder. 
    Example 
    25 
    let x = 5; 
    let y = 2; 
    let z = x % y; 
    Note: In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder. In 
    mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division. 
    Incrementing 
    The increment operator (++) increments numbers. 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    x++; 
    let z = x; 
    Decrementing 
    The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers. 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    x--; 
    let z = x; 
    Exponentiation 
    The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    let z = x ** 2; 
    x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y): 
    Example 
    let x = 5; 
    let z = Math.pow(x,2); 
    The += Operator 
    26 
    The Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable. 
    Addition Assignment Examples 
    let x = 10; 
    x += 5; 
    The -= Operator 
    The Subtraction Assignment Operator subtracts a value from a variable. 
    Subtraction Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x -= 5; 
    The *= Operator 
    The Multiplication Assignment Operator multiplies a variable. 
    Multiplication Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x *= 5; 
    The **= Operator 
    The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a variable to the power of the operand. 
    Exponentiation Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x **= 5; 
    The /= Operator 
    The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable. 
    Division Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x /= 5; 
    The %= Operator 
    27 
    The Remainder Assignment Operator assigns a remainder to a variable. 
    Remainder Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x %= 5; 
    The <<= Operator 
    The Left Shift Assignment Operator left shifts a variable. 
    Left Shift Assignment Example 
    let x = -100; 
    x <<= 5; 
    Example: 
    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html> 
    <body> 
    <h1>JavaScript Assignments</h1> 
    <h2>Left Shift Assignment</h2> 
    <h3>The <<= Operator</h3> 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    <script> 
    let x = -100; 
    x <<= 5; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x; 
    </script></body></html> 
    Output: Value of x is: -3200 
    The >>= Operator 
    The Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (signed). 
    28 
    Right Shift Assignment Example 
    let x = -100; 
    x >>= 5; 
    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html><body> 
    <h1>JavaScript Assignments</h1> 
    <h2>Right Shift Assignment</h2> 
    <h3>The >>= Operator</h3> 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    <script> 
    let x = -100; 
    x >>= 5; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x; 
    </script></body></html> 
    Output: Value of x is: -4 
    The >>>= Operator 
    The Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (unsigned). The 
    unsigned right shift ( >>> ) (zero-fill right shift) operator evaluates the left-hand operand as an 
    unsigned number, and shifts the binary representation of that number by the number of 
    bits, modulo 32, specified by the right-hand operand.
    Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Example 
    let x = -100; 
    x >>>= 5; 
    Example: 
    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html><body> 
    <h1>JavaScript Assignments</h1> 
    29 
    <h2>Right Shift Assignment</h2> 
    <h3>The >>>= Operator</h3> 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    <script> 
    let x = -100; 
    x >>>= 5; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x; 
    </script></body></html> 
    Output: Value of x is: 134217724 
    The &= Operator 
    The Bitwise AND Assignment Operator does a bitwise AND operation on two operands and 
    assigns the result to the the variable. 
    Bitwise AND Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x &= 5; 
    Example: 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    <script> 
    let x = 100; 
    x &= 5; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x; 
    </script> 
    The output: Value of x is: 4 
    The |= Operator 
    The Bitwise OR Assignment Operator does a bitwise OR operation on two operands and 
    assigns the result to the variable. 
    30 
    Bitwise OR Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x |= 5; 
    The output is: Value of x is: 101 
    The ^= Operator 
    The Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator does a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and 
    assigns the result to the variable. 
    Bitwise XOR Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x ^= 5; 
    The output is: Value of x is: 97 
    The &&= Operator 
    The Logical AND assignment operator is used between two values. 
    If the first value is true, the second value is assigned. 
    Logical AND Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x &&= 5; 
    The output: If the first value is true, the second value is assigned. Value of x is: 5 
    The ||= Operator 
    The Logical OR assignment operator is used between two values. 
    If the first value is false, the second value is assigned. 
    Logical OR Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x ||= 5; 
    The output: If the first value is false, the second value is assigned. The value of x is: 5 
    31 
    The ??= Operator 
    The Nullish coalescing assignment operator is used between two values. 
    If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned. 
    Nullish Coalescing Assignment Example 
    let x = 10; 
    x ??= 5; 
    The output: Value of x is: 100 
    JavaScript has 8 Datatypes 
    1. String 
    2. Number 
    3. Bigint 
    4. Boolean 
    5. Undefined 
    6. Null 
    7. Symbol 
    8. Object 
    The Object Datatype 
    The object data type can contain: 
    1. An object 
    2. An array 
    3. A date 
    Examples 
    // Numbers: 
    let length = 16; 
    let weight = 7.5; 
    // Strings: 
    let color = "Yellow"; 
    let lastName = "Johnson"; 
    // Booleans 
    let x = true; 
    32 
    let y = false; 
    // Object: 
    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; 
    // Array object: 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
    // Date object: 
    const date = new Date("2022-03-25"); 
    let x = "16" + "Volvo"; 
    Note 
    When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string. 
    Example 
    let x = 16 + "Volvo"; 
    Example 
    let x = "Volvo" + 16; 
    JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different 
    results: 
    Example: 
    let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo"; 
    JavaScript Types are Dynamic 
    JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different 
    data types: 
    Example 
    let x; // Now x is undefined 
    x = 5; // Now x is a Number 
    x = "John"; // Now x is a String
    JavaScript Strings 
    33 
    A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe". Strings are written with 
    quotes. You can use single or double quotes: 
    Example 
    // Using double quotes: 
    let carName1 = "Volvo XC60"; 
    // Using single quotes: 
    let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60'; 
    You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: 
    Example 
    // Single quote inside double quotes: 
    let answer1 = "It's alright"; 
    // Single quotes inside double quotes: 
    let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'"; 
    // Double quotes inside single quotes: 
    let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"'; 
    JavaScript Numbers 
    All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point). Numbers can be written 
    with, or without decimals: 
    Example 
    // With decimals: 
    let x1 = 34.00; 
    // Without decimals: 
    let x2 = 34; 
    Exponential Notation 
    Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation: 
    Example 
    34 
    let y = 123e5; // 12300000 
    let z = 123e-5; // 0.00123
    Javascript are always one type. Double (64-bit floating point). 
    JavaScript Arrays 
    JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas. The 
    following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names): 
    Example 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
    Add new elements at the beginning of an array using JavaScript 
    <body style="text-align:center;"> 
     <h1 style="color:green;"> 
     Hello World 
     </h1> 
     <h3>Add element using unshift()</h3> 
     <p id="up"></p> 
     <button onclick="myGFG()"> 
     Click to insert 
     </button> 
     <p id="down" style="color: green"></p> 
     <!-- Script to add element at beginning of array --> 
     <script> 
     var GFG_Array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
     var up = document.getElementById("up"); 
     up.innerHTML = GFG_Array; 
     var down = document.getElementById("down"); 
     down.innerHTML = "elements of GFG_Array = " 
    35 
     + GFG_Array; 
     
     function myGFG() { 
     GFG_Array.unshift("6"); 
     down = document.getElementById("down"); 
     down.innerHTML = "element of GFG_Array = " 
     + GFG_Array; } 
     </script> </body> 
    JavaScript Objects 
    JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. Object properties are written as name:value 
    pairs, separated by commas. 
    Example 
    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}; 
    The typeof Operator 
    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. 
    The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression: 
    Example 
    typeof "" // Returns "string" 
    typeof "John" // Returns "string" 
    typeof "John Doe" // Returns "string"
    Undefined 
    In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined. 
    Example 
    let car; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined. 
    36 
    Example 
    car = undefined; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    JavaScript Functions 
    A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
    // Function to compute the product of p1 and p2 
    function myFunction(p1, p2) { 
     return p1 * p2; 
    } 
    JavaScript Function Syntax 
    A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by 
    parentheses (). 
    Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as 
    variables). 
    The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: 
    (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
    The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
    Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. 
    Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. 
    Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables. 
    Function Invocation 
    The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function: 
     When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button) 
     When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code 
     Automatically (self invoked) 
    Function Return 
    37 
     When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. 
     If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code 
    after the invoking statement. 
     Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the 
    "caller": 
    Example: 
    let x = myFunction(4, 3); // Function is called, return value will end up in x 
    function myFunction(a, b) { 
     return a * b; // Function returns the product of a and b 
    } 
    Why Functions? 
    You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times. You can use the same code 
    many times with different arguments, to produce different results. 
    function toCelsius(fahrenheit) { 
     return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32); 
    } 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius(77); 
    The () Operator Invokes the Function 
    Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the 
    function result. Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the 
    function result. 
    function toCelsius(fahrenheit) { 
     return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32); 
    } 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius; 
    Functions Used as Variable Values 
    Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, 
    and calculations. 
    Example 
    38 
    Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function: 
    let x = toCelsius(77); 
    let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius"; 
    You can use the function directly, as a variable value: 
    let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius"; 
    Local Variables 
    Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local 
    variables can only be accessed from within the function. 
    // code here can NOT use carName 
    function myFunction() { 
     let carName = "Volvo"; 
     // code here CAN use carName 
    } 
    // code here can NOT use carName 
    Note: Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same 
    name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and 
    deleted when the function is completed. 
    JavaScript Objects 
    Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods 
    In real life, a car is an object. A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start 
    and stop: 
    Properties Methods 
    car.name = Fiat 
    car.model = 500 
    car.weight = 
    850kg 
    car.start() 
    car.drive() 
    car.brake() 
    39 
    car.color = white car.stop() 
    All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have 
    the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times. 
    JavaScript Objects 
    You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values. 
    This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car: 
    let car = "Fiat"; 
    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. This code assigns many 
    values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car. The values are written as name:value pairs 
    (name and value separated by a colon). 
    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}; 
    Object Definition 
    You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal: 
    Example: 
    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}; 
    or 
    const person = { 
     firstName: "John", 
     lastName: "Doe", 
     age: 50, 
     eyeColor: "blue"
    }; 
    Accessing Object Properties 
    You can access object properties in two ways: 
    objectName.propertyName
    40 
    or 
    objectName["propertyName"]
    Example: 
    person.lastName; or person["lastName"]; 
    Object Methods 
    Objects can also have methods. Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods 
    are stored in properties as function definitions. 
    Note: A method is a function stored as a property. 
    Property Property Value 
    firstName John 
    lastName Doe 
    age 50 
    eyeColor Blue 
    fullName function() {return this.firstName + " 
    " + this.lastName;} 
    const person = { 
     firstName: "John", 
     lastName : "Doe", 
     id : 5566, 
     fullName : function() { 
     return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; 
     } 
    }; 
    41 
    In the example above, this refers to the person object. this.firstName means 
    the firstName property of this. this.firstName means the firstName property of person. 
    What is this? 
    In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object. Which object depends on how this is being 
    invoked (used or called). 
    The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used: 
    In an object method, this refers to the object. 
    Alone, this refers to the global object. 
    In a function, this refers to the global object. 
    In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined. 
    In an event, this refers to the element that 
    received the event. 
    Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can 
    refer this to any object. 
    Note: this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.
    The this Keyword 
    In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function. In the example above, this is 
    the person object that "owns" the fullName function. 
    In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object. 
    Accessing Object Methods 
    You access an object method with the following syntax: 
    Example: 
    42 
    objectName.methodName() 
    name = person.fullName(); 
    If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition: 
    Example: 
    name = person.fullName; 
    Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects! 
    When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an 
    object: 
    x = new String(); // Declares x as a String object 
    y = new Number(); // Declares y as a Number object 
    z = new Boolean(); // Declares z as a Boolean object
    Note: Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down 
    execution speed. 
    JavaScript Events 
    HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML 
    pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events. 
    HTML Events 
    An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. 
    Here are some examples of HTML events: 
     An HTML web page has finished loading 
     An HTML input field was changed 
     An HTML button was clicked 
    Often, when events happen, you may want to do something. JavaScript lets you execute code 
    when events are detected. HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be 
    added to HTML elements. 
    With single quotes: 
    43 
    <element event='some JavaScript'>
    With double quotes: 
    <element event="some JavaScript">
    In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element: 
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time 
    is?</button> 
    In the example above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo". 
    In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML): 
    <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button> 
    <button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button> 
    Common HTML Events 
    Here is a list of some common HTML events: 
    Event Description 
    onchange An HTML element has been 
    changed 
    onclick The user clicks an HTML element
    onmouseover The user moves the mouse over 
    an HTML element 
    onmouseout The user moves the mouse away 
    from an HTML element 
    onkeydown The user pushes a keyboard key 
    44 
    onload The browser has finished loading 
    the page 
    JavaScript Event Handlers 
    Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions: 
     Things that should be done every time a page loads 
     Things that should be done when the page is closed 
     Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button 
     Content that should be verified when a user inputs data 
    JavaScript String Methods 
    String length 
    String slice() 
    String substring() 
    String substr() 
    String replace() 
    String replaceAll() 
    String toUpperCase() 
    String toLowerCase() 
    String concat() 
    String trim() 
    String trimStart() 
    String trimEnd() 
    String padStart() 
    String padEnd() 
    String charAt() 
    String charCodeAt() 
    String split() 
    JavaScript String Length 
    The length property returns the length of a string: 
    Example: 
    let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; 
    let length = text.length; 
    Extracting String Parts 
    There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string: 
     slice(start, end)
     substring(start, end)
     substr(start, length)
    JavaScript String slice() 
    45 
    slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string. 
    The method takes 2 parameters: start position, and end position (end not included). 
    Example 
    Slice out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 13: 
    let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = text.slice(7, 13); 
    Note: JavaScript counts positions from zero. First position is 0. Second position is 1. 
    Example: 
    If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string: 
    let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = text.slice(7); 
    Example: If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string: 
    let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = text.slice(-12); 
    Example: This example slices out a portion of a string from position -12 to position -6: 
    let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = text.slice(-12, -6); 
    JavaScript String substring() 
    substring() is similar to slice(). The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated 
    as 0 in substring(). 
    Example: 
    let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = str.substring(7, 13); 
    Note: If you omit the second parameter, substring() will slice out the rest of the string. 
    JavaScript String substr() 
    46 
    substr() is similar to slice(). The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of 
    the extracted part. 
    Example: 
    let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = str.substr(7, 6); 
    Note: If you omit the second parameter, substr() will slice out the rest of the string. 
    Example: 
    let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = str.substr(7); 
    If the first parameter is negative, the position counts from the end of the string. 
    Example: 
    let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"; 
    let part = str.substr(-4); 
    Replacing String Content 
    The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string: 
    Example: 
    let text = "Please visit Microsoft!"; 
    let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools"); 
    Note 
    The replace() method does not change the string it is called on. The replace() method returns a 
    new string. The replace() method replaces only the first match. If you want to replace all 
    matches, use a regular expression with the /g flag set. See examples below. 
    By default, the replace() method replaces only the first match: 
    let text = "Please visit Microsoft and Microsoft!"; 
    let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools"); 
    47 
    By default, the replace() method is case sensitive. Writing MICROSOFT (with upper-case) will 
    not work: 
    let text = "Please visit Microsoft!"; 
    let newText = text.replace("MICROSOFT", "W3Schools"); 
    To replace case insensitive, use a regular expression with an /i flag (insensitive): 
    let text = "Please visit Microsoft!"; 
    let newText = text.replace(/MICROSOFT/i, "W3Schools"); 
    Note: Regular expressions are written without quotes. 
    To replace all matches, use a regular expression with a /g flag (global match): 
    let text = "Please visit Microsoft and Microsoft!"; 
    let newText = text.replace(/Microsoft/g, "W3Schools"); 
    JavaScript String ReplaceAll() 
    Note: It does not work in Internet Explorer 
    In 2021, JavaScript introduced the string method replaceAll(): 
    text = text.replaceAll("Cats","Dogs"); 
    text = text.replaceAll("cats","dogs"); 
    Converting to Upper and Lower Case 
    A string is converted to upper case with toUpperCase(). A string is converted to lower case 
    with toLowerCase(): 
    JavaScript String toUpperCase() 
    let text1 = "Hello World!"; 
    let text2 = text1.toUpperCase(); 
    JavaScript String toLowerCase() 
    let text1 = "Hello World!"; // String 
    let text2 = text1.toLowerCase(); // text2 is text1 converted to lower 
    JavaScript String concat() 
    48 
    concat() joins two or more strings: 
    let text1 = "Hello"; 
    let text2 = "World"; 
    let text3 = text1.concat(" ", text2); 
    The concat() method can be used instead of the plus operator. These two lines do the same: 
    text = "Hello" + " " + "World!"; 
    text = "Hello".concat(" ", "World!"); 
    Note: All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string. 
    JavaScript String trim() 
    The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string: 
    let text1 = " Hello World! "; 
    let text2 = text1.trim(); 
    JavaScript String trimStart() 
    The trimStart() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the start of a string. 
    let text1 = " Hello World! "; 
    let text2 = text1.trimStart(); 
    JavaScript String trimEnd() 
    The trimEnd() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the end of a string. 
    let text1 = " Hello World! "; 
    let text2 = text1.trimEnd(); 
    JavaScript String Padding 
    JavaScript String padStart() 
    The padStart() method pads a string with another string: 
    let text = "5"; 
    let padded = text.padStart(4,"x"); 
    Note: The padStart() method is a string method. To pad a number, convert the number to a string 
    first. 
    Try this: 
    49 
    let text = "5"; 
    let padded = text.padStart(4,"0"); 
    Example: 
    let numb = 5; 
    let text = numb.toString(); 
    let padded = text.padStart(4,"0"); 
    JavaScript String padEnd() 
    The padEnd() method pads a string with another string: 
    let text = "5"; 
    let padded = text.padEnd(4,"x"); 
    Note: The padEnd() method is a string method. To pad a number, convert the number to a string 
    first. 
    Try this: 
    let text = "5"; 
    let padded = text.padEnd(4,"0"); 
    Example: 
    let numb = 5; 
    let text = numb.toString(); 
    let padded = text.padEnd(4,"0"); 
    Extracting String Characters 
    There are 3 methods for extracting string characters: 
     charAt(position)
     charCodeAt(position)
     Property access [ ] 
    JavaScript String charAt() 
     The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string: 
    let text = "HELLO WORLD"; 
    let char = text.charAt(0); 
    50 
    JavaScript String charCodeAt() 
    The charCodeAt() method returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string. 
    The method returns a UTF-16 code (an integer between 0 and 65535). 
    let text = "HELLO WORLD"; 
    let char = text.charCodeAt(0); 
    Property Access 
    Note: Property access might be a little unpredictable:
     It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not) 
     If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string. 
     It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!) 
    Converting a String to an Array 
    If you want to work with a string as an array, you can convert it to an array. 
     JavaScript String split() 
    A string can be converted to an array with the split() method: 
    text.split(",") // Split on commas 
    text.split(" ") // Split on spaces 
    text.split("|") // Split on pipe 
    If the separator is omitted, the returned array will contain the whole string in index [0]. If the 
    separator is "", the returned array will be an array of single characters: 
    text.split("") 
    JavaScript Booleans 
    Boolean Values 
    Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like 
     YES / NO 
     ON / OFF 
     TRUE / FALSE 
    For this, JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false. 
    51 
    The Boolean() Function 
    You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true: 
    Example: 
    Boolean(10 > 9) 
    Or even easier: 
    (10 > 9) 
    10 > 9 
    Comparisons and Conditions 
    The chapter JS Comparisons gives a full overview of comparison operators. 
    The chapter JS Conditions gives a full overview of conditional statements. 
    Here are some examples: 
    Operator Description Example 
    == equal to if (day == 
    "Monday") 
    > greater than if (salary > 
    9000) 
    < less than if (age < 18) 
    Everything With a "Value" is True 
    100
    3.14
    -15
    52 
    "Hello"
    "false"
    7 + 1 + 3.14 
    Everything Without a "Value" is False 
    The Boolean value of 0 (zero) is false. 
    let x = 0; 
    Boolean(x); 
    The Boolean value of -0 (minus zero) is false: 
    let x = -0; 
    Boolean(x); 
    The Boolean value of "" (empty string) is false: 
    let x = ""; 
    Boolean(x); 
    The Boolean value of undefined is false: 
    let x; 
    Boolean(x); 
    The Boolean value of null is false: 
    let x = null; 
    Boolean(x); 
    JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators 
    Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action 
    depending on the result: 
    if (age < 18) text = "Too young to buy alcohol"; 
    Logical Operators 
    Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. 
    53 
    Given that x = 6 and y = 3, the table below explains the logical operators: 
    Operator Description Example 
    && and (x < 10 && y > 1) is 
    true 
    || or (x == 5 || y == 5) is 
    false 
    ! not !(x == y) is true 
    Conditional (Ternary) Operator 
    JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some 
    condition. 
    Syntax 
    variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2 
    Example: 
    let voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough"; 
    Note: To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type before 
    comparison: 
    age = Number(age); 
    if (isNaN(age)) { 
     voteable = "Input is not a number"; 
    } else { 
     voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough"; 
    } 
    The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??) 
    54 
    The ?? operator returns the first argument if it is not nullish (null or undefined). Otherwise it 
    returns the second argument. 
    Example: 
    let name = null; 
    let text = "missing"; 
    let result = name ?? text; 
    The Optional Chaining Operator (?.) 
    The ?. operator returns undefined if an object is undefined or null (instead of throwing an error). 
    Example: 
    // Create an object: 
    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}; 
    // Ask for car name: 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = car?.name; 
    JavaScript if, else, and else if 
    Conditional Statements 
    Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions. 
    You can use conditional statements in your code to do this. In JavaScript we have the following 
    conditional statements: 
     Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true 
     Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false 
     Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false 
     Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed 
    The if Statement: Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a 
    condition is true. Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters IF will generate a 
    JavaScript error. 
    Example: 
    if (hour < 18) { 
     greeting = "Good day"; 
    } 
    The else Statement 
    55 
    Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false. 
    if (condition) { 
     // block of code to be executed if the condition is true 
    } else { 
     // block of code to be executed if the condition is false 
    } 
    Example: 
    if (hour < 18) { 
     greeting = "Good day"; 
    } else { 
     greeting = "Good evening"; 
    } 
    The else if Statement 
    Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false. 
    Example: 
    if (time < 10) { 
     greeting = "Good morning"; 
    } else if (time < 20) { 
     greeting = "Good day"; 
    } else { 
     greeting = "Good evening"; 
    } 
    The JavaScript Switch Statement: Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to 
    be executed. 
    Syntax 
    switch(expression) { 
     case x: 
     // code block 
     break; 
     case y: 
     // code block 
     break; 
     default: 
     // code block
    } 
    56 
    This is how it works: 
     The switch expression is evaluated once. 
     The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. 
     If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed. 
     If there is no match, the default code block is executed. 
    Example: 
    switch (new Date().getDay()) { 
     case 0: 
     day = "Sunday"; 
     break; 
     case 1: 
     day = "Monday"; 
     break; 
     case 2: 
     day = "Tuesday"; 
     break; 
     case 3: 
     day = "Wednesday"; 
     break; 
     case 4: 
     day = "Thursday"; 
     break; 
     case 5: 
     day = "Friday"; 
     break; 
     case 6: 
     day = "Saturday"; 
    } 
    The break Keyword 
    When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the 
    execution inside the switch block. It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The 
    block breaks (ends) there anyway. 
    Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does 
    not match the case. If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected. If no 
    matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label. If no default label is found, 
    the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch. 
    57 
    The default Keyword 
    The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match: 
    Example: 
    switch (new Date().getDay()) { 
     case 6: 
     text = "Today is Saturday"; 
     break; 
     case 0: 
     text = "Today is Sunday"; 
     break; 
     default: 
     text = "Looking forward to the Weekend"; 
    } 
    Note: The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block: 
    Example: 
    switch (new Date().getDay()) { 
     default: 
     text = "Looking forward to the Weekend"; 
     break; 
     case 6: 
     text = "Today is Saturday"; 
     break; 
     case 0: 
     text = "Today is Sunday"; 
    } 
    Strict Comparison 
    Switch cases use strict comparison (===). The values must be of the same type to match. A strict 
    comparison can only be true if the operands are of the same type. 
    In this example there will be no match for x: 
    let x = "0"; 
    switch (x) { 
     case 0: 
     text = "Off"; 
    58 
     break; 
     case 1: 
     text = "On"; 
     break; 
     default: 
     text = "No value found"; 
    } 
    JavaScript For Loop 
    Example: 
    for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) { 
     text += cars[i] + "<br>"; 
    } 
    The For Loop 
    The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions: 
    for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) { 
     // code block to be executed
    } 
    Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. Expression 
    2 defines the condition for executing the code block. Expression 3 is executed (every time) after 
    the code block has been executed. 
    Example: 
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
     text += "The number is " + i + "<br>"; 
    } 
    Example: 
    let i = 2; 
    let len = cars.length; 
    let text = ""; 
    for (; i < len; i++) { 
    59 
     text += cars[i] + "<br>"; 
    } 
    Note: In the first example, using var, the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable 
    outside the loop. In the second example, using let, the variable declared in the loop does not 
    redeclare the variable outside the loop. When let is used to declare the i variable in a loop, the i 
    variable will only be visible within the loop. 
    Example: 
    var i = 5; 
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
     // some code 
    } 
    // Here i is 10 
    Example: 
    let i = 5; 
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
     // some code 
    } 
    // Here i is 5 
    The For In Loop 
    Example: 
    const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; 
    let text = ""; 
    for (let x in person) { 
     text += person[x]; 
    } 
    For In used in arrays 
    Example: 
    60 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let txt = ""; 
    for (let x in numbers) { 
     txt += numbers[x]; 
    } 
    Array.forEach() 
    The forEach() method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element. 
    Example: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let txt = ""; 
    numbers.forEach(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value, index, array) { 
     txt += value; 
    } 
    JavaScript For Of 
    Example: 
    const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"]; 
    let text = ""; 
    for (let x of cars) { 
     text += x; 
    } 
    Example: 
    let language = "JavaScript"; 
    let text = ""; 
    for (let x of language) { 
    text += x; 
    } 
    61 
    The While Loop: The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition 
    is true. 
    Example: 
    while (i < 10) { 
     text += "The number is " + i; 
     i++; 
    } 
    The Do While Loop: The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the 
    code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as 
    the condition is true. 
    Example: 
    do { 
     text += "The number is " + i; 
     i++; 
    } 
    while (i < 10); 
    JavaScript Break and Continue 
    The Break Statement: The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop: 
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
     if (i === 3) { break; } 
     text += "The number is " + i + "<br>"; 
    } 
    The Continue Statement: The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified 
    condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop. This example skips the value 
    of 3: 
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
     if (i === 3) { continue; } 
     text += "The number is " + i + "<br>"; 
    } 
    JavaScript Arrays 
    An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value: 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
    Why Use Arrays? 
    62 
    If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables 
    could look like this: 
    let car1 = "Saab"; 
    let car2 = "Volvo"; 
    let car3 = "BMW"; 
    Creating an Array 
    Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array. 
    Syntax: 
    const array_name = [item1, item2, ...]; 
    Note: It is a common practice arrays with the const keyword. 
    Accessing Array Elements 
    You access an array element by referring to the index number: 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
    let car = cars[0]; 
    Changing an Array Element 
    This statement changes the value of the first element in cars: 
    cars[0] = "Opel"; 
    Example: 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
    cars[0] = "Opel"; 
    Access the Full Array 
    With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name: 
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars; 
    Arrays are Objects 
    Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays. 
    Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John: 
    63 
    Example: 
    const person = ["John", "Doe", 46]; 
    Objects use names to access its "members". In this example, person.firstName returns John: 
    Object: 
    const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46}; 
    Array Elements Can Be Objects 
    JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects. Because of this, you can 
    have variables of different types in the same Array. You can have objects in an Array. You can 
    have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array: 
    myArray[0] = Date.now; 
    myArray[1] = myFunction; 
    myArray[2] = myCars; 
    Array Properties and Methods 
    The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods: 
    cars.length // Returns the number of elements 
    cars.sort() // Sorts the array
    The length Property 
    The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements). 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let length = fruits.length; 
    Accessing the First Array Element 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let fruit = fruits[0]; 
    Accessing the Last Array Element 
    Example: 
    64 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1]; 
    Looping Array Elements 
    One way to loop through an array, is using a for loop: 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let fLen = fruits.length; 
    let text = "<ul>"; 
    for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) { 
     text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>"; 
    } 
    text += "</ul>"; 
    You can also use the Array.forEach() function: 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let text = "<ul>"; 
    fruits.forEach(myFunction); 
    text += "</ul>"; 
    function myFunction(value) { 
     text += "<li>" + value + "</li>"; 
    } 
    Adding Array Elements 
    The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the push() method: 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"]; 
    fruits.push("Lemon"); // Adds a new element (Lemon) to fruits 
    New element can also be added to an array using the length property: 
    65 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"]; 
    fruits[fruits.length] = "Lemon"; // Adds "Lemon" to fruits 
    Warning: Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined “holes” in an array. 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"]; 
    fruits[6] = "Lemon"; // Creates undefined "holes" in fruits 
    Associative Arrays 
    Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes. Arrays with named indexes 
    are called associative arrays (or hashes). JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes. 
    In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes. 
    const person = []; 
    person[0] = "John"; 
    person[1] = "Doe"; 
    person[2] = 46; 
    person.length; // Will return 3 
    person[0]; // Will return "John" 
    Note: If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to an object. After that, some 
    array methods and properties will produce incorrect results. 
    Example: 
    const person = []; 
    person["firstName"] = "John"; 
    person["lastName"] = "Doe"; 
    person["age"] = 46; 
    person.length; // Will return 0 
    person[0]; // Will return undefined 
    The Difference Between Arrays and Objects 
    In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes. In JavaScript, objects use named indexes. 
    When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects. 
    66 
     JavaScript does not support associative arrays. 
     You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text). 
     You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers. 
    JavaScript new Array() 
    JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array(). But you can safely use [] instead. These 
    two different statements both create a new empty array named points: 
    const points = new Array(); 
    const points = []; 
    These two different statements both create a new array containing 6 numbers: 
    const points = new Array(40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10); 
    const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 
    JavaScript Array Methods 
    Converting Arrays to Strings 
    The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array 
    values. 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString(); 
    The join() method also joins all array elements into a string. It behaves just like toString(), but in 
    addition you can specify the separator: 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.join(" * "); 
    Popping and Pushing 
    When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements. This is what 
    popping and pushing is. Popping items out of an array, or pushing items into an array. 
    67 
    JavaScript Array pop() 
    The pop() method removes the last element from an array: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.pop(); 
    The pop() method returns the value that was "popped out": 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let fruit = fruits.pop(); 
    JavaScript Array push() 
    The push() method adds a new element to an array (at the end): 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.push("Kiwi"); 
    The push() method returns the new array length: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let length = fruits.push("Kiwi"); 
    JavaScript Array shift() 
    The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower 
    index. 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.shift(); 
    The shift() method returns the value that was "shifted out": 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let fruit = fruits.shift(); 
    JavaScript Array unshift() 
    The unshift() method adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older 
    elements: 
    68 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.unshift("Lemon"); 
    The unshift() method returns the new array length: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.unshift("Lemon"); 
    Changing Elements 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits[0] = "Kiwi"; 
    JavaScript Array length 
    The length property provides an easy way to append a new element to an array: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits[fruits.length] = "Kiwi"; 
    JavaScript Array delete() 
    Note: Array elements can be deleted using the JavaScript operator delete. 
    Using delete leaves undefined holes in the array. Use pop() or shift() instead. 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    delete fruits[0]; 
    Merging (Concatenating) Arrays 
    The concat() method creates a new array by merging (concatenating) existing arrays: 
    const myGirls = ["Cecilie", "Lone"]; 
    const myBoys = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"]; 
    const myChildren = myGirls.concat(myBoys); 
    Note: The concat() method does not change the existing arrays. It always returns a new array. 
    Merging three Arrays 
    const arr1 = ["Cecilie", "Lone"]; 
    const arr2 = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"]; 
    const arr3 = ["Robin", "Morgan"]; 
    const myChildren = arr1.concat(arr2, arr3); 
    69 
    The concat() method can also take strings as arguments: 
    const arr1 = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"]; 
    const myChildren = arr1.concat("Peter"); 
    Splicing and Slicing Arrays 
    The splice() method adds new items to an array. The slice() method slices out a piece of an array. 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi"); 
    The first parameter (2) defines the position where new elements should be added (spliced in). 
    The second parameter (0) defines how many elements should be removed. The rest of the 
    parameters ("Lemon" , "Kiwi") define the new elements to be added. 
    The splice() method returns an array with the deleted items: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.splice(2, 2, "Lemon", "Kiwi"); 
    JavaScript Array slice() 
    The slice() method slices out a piece of an array into a new array. This example slices out a part 
    of an array starting from array element 1 ("Orange"): 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    const citrus = fruits.slice(1); 
    Note: The slice() method creates a new array. The slice() method does not remove any elements 
    from the source array. 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    const citrus = fruits.slice(3); 
    The slice() method can take two arguments like slice(1, 3). The method then selects elements 
    from the start argument, and up to (but not including) the end argument. 
    Example: 
    70 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    const citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3); 
    If the end argument is omitted, like in the first examples, the slice() method slices out the rest of 
    the array. 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    const citrus = fruits.slice(2); 
    Automatic toString() 
    JavaScript automatically converts an array to a comma separated string when a primitive value is 
    expected. This is always the case when you try to output an array. These two examples will 
    produce the same result: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString(); 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits; 
    Note: All JavaScript objects have a toString() method. 
    Sorting an Array 
    The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.sort(); 
    Reversing an Array 
    The reverse() method reverses the elements in an array. You can use it to sort an array in 
    descending order: 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    fruits.sort(); 
    fruits.reverse(); 
    Numeric Sort 
    By default, the sort() function sorts values as strings. This works well for strings ("Apple" 
    comes before "Banana"). However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", 
    71 
    because "2" is bigger than "1". Because of this, the sort() method will produce incorrect result 
    when sorting numbers. You can fix this by providing a compare function: 
    const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 
    points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b}); 
    Use the same trick to sort an array descending: 
    const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 
    points.sort(function(a, b){return b - a}); 
    The Compare Function 
    The purpose of the compare function is to define an alternative sort order. The compare function 
    should return a negative, zero, or positive value, depending on the arguments: 
    function(a, b){return a - b} 
    When the sort() function compares two values, it sends the values to the compare function, and 
    sorts the values according to the returned (negative, zero, positive) value. If the result is 
    negative, a is sorted before b. If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. If the result is 0, no 
    changes are done with the sort order of the two values. 
    Example:
    The compare function compares all the values in the array, two values at a time (a, b). When 
    comparing 40 and 100, the sort() method calls the compare function(40, 100). The function 
    calculates 40 - 100 (a - b), and since the result is negative (-60), the sort function will sort 40 as 
    a value lower than 100. You can use this code snippet to experiment with numerically and 
    alphabetically sorting: 
    <button onclick="myFunction1()">Sort Alphabetically</button>
    <button onclick="myFunction2()">Sort Numerically</button>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
    const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = points; 
    function myFunction1() { 
    72 
     points.sort(); 
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = points; 
    } 
    function myFunction2() { 
     points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b}); 
     document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = points; 
    } 
    </script> 
    Find the Highest (or Lowest) Array Value 
    There are no built-in functions for finding the max or min value in an array. However, after you 
    have sorted an array, you can use the index to obtain the highest and lowest values. Sorting 
    ascending: 
    const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 
    points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b}); 
    // now points[0] contains the lowest value 
    // and points[points.length-1] contains the highest value 
    Sorting descending: 
    const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 
    points.sort(function(a, b){return b - a}); 
    // now points[0] contains the highest value 
    // and points[points.length-1] contains the lowest value 
    Using Math.max() on an Array 
    You can use Math.max.apply to find the highest number in an array: 
    function myArrayMax(arr) { 
     return Math.max.apply(null, arr); 
    } 
    Math.max.apply(null, [1, 2, 3]) is equivalent to Math.max(1, 2, 3). 
    Using Math.min() on an Array 
    You can use Math.min.apply to find the lowest number in an array: 
    73 
    function myArrayMin(arr) { 
     return Math.min.apply(null, arr); 
    } 
    My Min / Max JavaScript Methods 
    function myArrayMax(arr) { 
     let len = arr.length; 
     let max = -Infinity; 
     while (len--) { 
     if (arr[len] > max) { 
     max = arr[len]; 
     } 
     } 
     return max; 
    } 
    This function loops through an array comparing each value with the lowest value found: 
    function myArrayMin(arr) { 
     let len = arr.length; 
     let min = Infinity; 
     while (len--) { 
     if (arr[len] < min) { 
     min = arr[len]; 
     } 
     } 
     return min; 
    } 
    Sorting Object Arrays 
    const cars = [ 
    {type:"Volvo", year:2016}, 
    {type:"Saab", year:2001}, 
    {type:"BMW", year:2010} 
    ]; 
    cars.sort(function(a, b){return a.year - b.year}); 
    74 
    cars.sort(function(a, b){ 
     let x = a.type.toLowerCase(); 
     let y = b.type.toLowerCase(); 
     if (x < y) {return -1;} 
     if (x > y) {return 1;} 
     return 0; 
    }); 
    JavaScript Array Iteration 
    JavaScript Array forEach() 
    The forEach() method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element. 
    Example: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let txt = ""; 
    numbers.forEach(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value, index, array) { 
     txt += value + "<br>"; 
    } 
    Note that the function takes 3 arguments: 
     The item value 
     The item index 
     The array itself 
    The example above uses only the value parameter. The example can be rewritten to: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let txt = ""; 
    numbers.forEach(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value) { 
     txt += value + "<br>"; 
    } 
    JavaScript Array map() 
    The map() method creates a new array by performing a function on each array element. 
    75 
    The map() method does not execute the function for array elements without values. 
    The map() method does not change the original array. 
    This example multiplies each array value by 2: 
    Example: 
    const numbers1 = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    const numbers2 = numbers1.map(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value, index, array) { 
     return value * 2; 
    } 
    Note that the function takes 3 arguments: 
     The item value 
     The item index 
     The array itself 
    When a callback function uses only the value parameter, the index and array parameters can be 
    omitted: 
    Example: 
    const numbers1 = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    const numbers2 = numbers1.map(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value) { 
     return value * 2; 
    } 
    JavaScript Array filter() 
    The filter() method creates a new array with array elements that pass a test. 
    This example creates a new array from elements with a value larger than 18: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    const over18 = numbers.filter(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value, index, array) { 
    76 
     return value > 18; 
    } 
    Note that the function takes 3 arguments: 
     The item value 
     The item index 
     The array itself 
    In the example above, the callback function does not use the index and array parameters, so they 
    can be omitted: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    const over18 = numbers.filter(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value) { 
     return value > 18; 
    } 
    JavaScript Array reduce() 
    The reduce() method runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a single 
    value. The reduce() method works from left-to-right in the array. The reduce() method does not 
    reduce the original array. 
    Example: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(total, value, index, array) { 
     return total + value; 
    } 
    Note that the function takes 4 arguments: 
     The total (the initial value / previously returned value) 
     The item value 
     The item index 
     The array itself 
    The example above does not use the index and array parameters. It can be rewritten to: 
    77 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(total, value) { 
     return total + value; 
    } 
    The reduce() method can accept an initial value: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let sum = numbers.reduce(myFunction, 100); 
    function myFunction(total, value) { 
     return total + value; 
    } 
    JavaScript Array reduceRight() 
    The reduceRight() method runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a 
    single value. The reduceRight() works from right-to-left in the array. The reduceRight() method 
    does not reduce the original array. 
    Example: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let sum = numbers.reduceRight(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(total, value, index, array) { 
     return total + value; 
    } 
    Note that the function takes 4 arguments: 
     The total (the initial value / previously returned value) 
     The item value 
     The item index 
     The array itself 
    The example above does not use the index and array parameters. It can be rewritten to: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let sum = numbers.reduceRight(myFunction); 
    78 
    function myFunction(total, value) { 
     return total + value; 
    } 
    JavaScript Array every() 
    The every() method checks if all array values pass a test. This example checks if all array values 
    are larger than 18: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let allOver18 = numbers.every(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value, index, array) { 
     return value > 18; 
    } 
    Example 1: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let allOver18 = numbers.every(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value) { 
     return value > 18; 
    } 
    JavaScript Array some() 
    The some() method checks if some array values pass a test. This example checks if some array 
    values are larger than 18: 
    Example: 
    const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25]; 
    let someOver18 = numbers.some(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value, index, array) { 
     return value > 18; 
    } 
    JavaScript Array indexOf() 
    The indexOf() method searches an array for an element value and returns its position. 
    79 
    Example: 
    const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let position = fruits.indexOf("Apple") + 1; 
    Note: Array.indexOf() returns -1 if the item is not found. If the item is present more than once, it 
    returns the position of the first occurrence. 
    JavaScript Array lastIndexOf() 
    Array.lastIndexOf() is the same as Array.indexOf(), but returns the position of the last 
    occurrence of the specified element. 
    const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let position = fruits.lastIndexOf("Apple") + 1; 
    JavaScript Array find() 
    The find() method returns the value of the first array element that passes a test function. This 
    example finds (returns the value of) the first element that is larger than 18: 
    const numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 29]; 
    let first = numbers.find(myFunction); 
    function myFunction(value, index, array) { 
     return value > 18; 
    } 
    JavaScript Math Object 
    Math.PI; 
    Example: 
    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html><body> 
    <h2>JavaScript Math.PI</h2> 
    <p>Math.PI returns the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter:</p> 
    80 
    <p id="demo"></p><script> 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Math.PI;</script></body></html> 
    The output: Math.PI returns the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. 
    3.141592653589793 
    The Math Object 
    Unlike other objects, the Math object has no constructor. The Math object is static. 
    Example: 
    Math.E // returns Euler's number 
    Math.PI // returns PI 
    Math.SQRT2 // returns the square root of 2 
    Math.SQRT1_2 // returns the square root of 1/2 
    Math.LN2 // returns the natural logarithm of 2 
    Math.LN10 // returns the natural logarithm of 10 
    Math.LOG2E // returns base 2 logarithm of E 
    Math.LOG10E // returns base 10 logarithm of E 
    Number to Integer 
    There are 4 common methods to round a number to an integer: 
    Math.round(x) Returns x rounded to its nearest 
    integer 
    Math.ceil(x) Returns x rounded up to its nearest 
    integer 
    Math.floor(x) Returns x rounded down to its 
    nearest integer 
    Math.trunc(x) Returns the integer part of x 
    Math.round() 
    81 
    Math.round(x) returns the nearest integer: 
    Example: 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    <script> 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Math.round(4.6); 
    </script> 
    The output: 5 
    Math.ceil() 
    Math.ceil(x) returns the value of x rounded up to its nearest integer: 
    Example: 
    Math.ceil(4.9); 
    Math.floor() 
    Math.floor(x) returns the value of x rounded down to its nearest integer: 
    Example: 
    Math.floor(4.9); 
    Math.trunc() 
    Math.trunc(x) returns the integer part of x: 
    Example: Math.trunc(4.9); 
    Math.sign() 
    Math.sign(x) returns if x is negative, null or positive: 
    82 
    Example: Math.sign(-4); 
    Math.pow() 
    Math.pow(x, y) returns the value of x to the power of y: 
    Example: Math.pow(8, 2); 
    Math.sqrt() 
    Math.sqrt(x) returns the square root of x: 
    Example: Math.sqrt(64); 
    Math.abs() 
    Math.abs(x) returns the absolute (positive) value of x: 
    Example: Math.abs(-4.7); 
    Math.sin() 
    Math.sin(x) returns the sine (a value between -1 and 1) of the angle x (given in radians). 
    Example: Math.sin(90 * Math.PI / 180); // returns 1 (the sine of 90 degrees) 
    Math.min() and Math.max() 
    Math.min() and Math.max() can be used to find the lowest or highest value in a list of 
    arguments: 
    Example: Math.min(0, 150, 30, 20, -8, -200); 
    Math.random() 
    Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive): 
    Example: Math.random();

    JavaScript Object toString() 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    let text = fruits.toString(); 
    Example: 
    <p id="demo"></p><script> 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]; 
    const myArray = fruits.toString(); 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myArray; 
    </script> 
    The output: The result of using toString() on an array. Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango 
    1. Using toString() on an object: 
    const person = { 
     firstName: "John", 
     lastName: "Doe", 
     age: 50, 
     eyeColor: "blue"
    }; 
    const keys = person.toString(); 
    Example: 
    <html> 
    <body> 
    <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1> 
    <h2>The toString() Method</h2> 
    <p>The toString() method returns "[object Type]" if it cannot return a proper string:</p> 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    84 
    <script> 
    const person = { 
     firstName: "John", 
     lastName: "Doe", 
     age: 50, 
     eyeColor: "blue" 
    }; 
    const keys = person.toString(); 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = keys; 
    </script></body></html> 
    2. Using Object.toString() on an object: 
    const person = { 
     firstName: "John", 
     lastName: "Doe", 
     age: 50, 
     eyeColor: "blue"
    }; 
    const keys = Object.toString(person); 
    Example 
    <html><body> 
    <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1> 
    <h2>The Object.toString() Method</h2> 
    <p>Using Object.toString() returns the object constructor:</p> 
    <p id="demo"></p> 
    <script> 
    85 
    const person = { 
     firstName: "John", 
     lastName: "Doe", 
     age: 50, 
     eyeColor: "blue" 
    }; 
    const keys = Object.toString(person); 
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = keys; 
    </script></body></html> 
    The output: Using Object.toString() returns the object constructor. 
    function Object() { [native code] } 
    Definition and Usage 
    The toString() method returns an object as a string and it returns "[object Object]" if it cannot 
    return a string. The toString() method does not change the original object. Whereas 
    Object.toString() always returns the object constructor. 
    JavaScript Date Objects 
    const d = new Date(); 
    or 
    const d = new Date("2022-03-25"); 
    Creating Date Objects 
    Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor. 
    There are 9 ways to create a new date object: 
    86 
    new Date() 
    new Date(date string) 
    new Date(year,month) 
    new Date(year,month,day) 
    new Date(year,month,day,hours) 
    new Date(year,month,day,hours,minutes) 
    new Date(year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds) 
    new Date(year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds,ms) 
    new Date(milliseconds) 
    new Date(date string) 
    new Date(date string) creates a date object from a date string: 
    const d = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00");
